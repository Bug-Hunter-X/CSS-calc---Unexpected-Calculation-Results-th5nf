This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle bug involving the CSS `calc()` function.  The bug arises from a misunderstanding of operator precedence within the `calc()` expression and how it interacts with other layout properties. The `bug.css` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` provides a corrected version.  The issue is elaborated in the comments within the CSS files.

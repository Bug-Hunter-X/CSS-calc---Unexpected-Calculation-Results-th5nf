The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations with different units, but it can sometimes lead to unexpected results if the order of operations isn't carefully considered.  For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(100% - (20px + 10px));` might behave differently than anticipated due to operator precedence.  Similarly, combining `calc()` with other CSS properties that affect layout can create unexpected behavior if the calculation doesn't properly account for the context.
